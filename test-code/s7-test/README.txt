Code to test latest s7 with loop macro on both OSX and Windows

Prep:
- versions of s7.c and s7.h downloaded today 2020-05-09
- run update_s7.sh to grab latest s7.c and s7.h from the github mirror
  https://github.com/spurious/snd-mirror/blob/master/s7.c

Compile:

OSX:
  gcc -c s7.c
  gcc s7-test.c -L. -I. s7.o -lm

Windows: 
  open s7-test.vcxproj in VS2019, and build.

Results:
(Iain's results, 2020-05-09)
OSX:
  works as expected, s7 builds, loop macro does it's thing

Win 10, VS 2019:  
  compiling S7 throws errors for lines 11121 to 11125: 
  Error	C2491	'asinh': definition of dllimport function not allowed
  Error	C2491	'acosh': definition of dllimport function not allowed
  Error	C2491	'atanh': definition of dllimport function not allowed
  Error	C2491	'cbrt': definition of dllimport function not allowed
  - IAIN: I can comment these out to build successfully
  
  - program runs fine, unless there is a call to loop, in which case it hangs
