Notes on the gc clock feature

- messages:
  gc-ms
  gc-start
  gc-stop
  
- gc-ms sets the gc timer, disabling auto gc and starts running it on the timer
- the callback for the gc clock (s4m_gc_ms_cb) resets the high level gc enabled flag to whatever it was
  so that it runs without changing this (it will always run it)
- gc-start starts the gc timer and disables auto gc
- gc-stop stops the timer and renables auto gc
- (gc-ms-set! 500) - sets the gc timer interval but, unlike the Max message, does not start the clock

- attempting to call any gc-ms related functions when thread is low will
  print error message and abort
- this includes setting @thread l @gc-ms X in object attributes
