Plan for version 0.2
- table i/o
- buffer i/o
- scheduling with ms
- scheduling with clock

Status:
- regression test suite working for the schedule and transport tests
- working on completing the regression test suite
- 


V0.2 need to do:
- add the global control for turning off logging
- add the table tests to the regression suite

table-io-tests-1 is not working right (not all passing)


Regression Suite:
- buffer tests:
 - done except for channel specific versions of stuff 
 - could return to those later


Buffer thoughts:
- leave bufsv polymorphic and later make bufsv*, an optimized non-polymorphic version that requires all args
  and thus has do less argument checking per call
