S4M array notes, sept 2022

- there are tests for all the types (i,f,s,c) in scm/array_tests.scm
  - they test make-array, arrsv, a->v, array-ref, and array-set!
  - these need to be added to the regression suite though

WORKING 
- make-array
- array->vector
- arrsv (array set from vector)
- array-ref
- array-set!

- s4m_free_array - sort of working

TODO:
- bring back vector set from array later, ok without it for now
- add the array tests to the main regression suite



ISSUES:
- what happens if we make a new array overwriting a previous one?
  - it should automatically free the old one
- have I written free functions for these properly?
  - what happens if an s4m instance is delete when an array exists?
    - doesn't crash
- do we protect against trying to put bad types in the array yet?

- is it working with p
